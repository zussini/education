# Hi, my name is Piotr and I am a biologist (my first degree) and a physicist (my second degree + Phd) and during my Phd studies I was also teaching on university and in schools. In schools I was teaching computer science for a veriety of group ages. I found out that programming skills can be used to learn LOTS of different things, so I decided to make a repository with some ideas for myself and maybe some teachers about ways to present different topics in CS, math, physics and other fields. If you like it, dislike it or have some suggestions then feel free to write it. If you have some requests or questions regarding methodology how to present some ideas to students feel free to ask as well. Might not find the best way, but at least I will try to be helpful.
# education

This is personal repository with examples regarding educational computable examples. 
The first idea is that it will be mostly math, but could diverge or fluctuate to other disciplines, like physics.
